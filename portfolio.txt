<t> I am a Computer Science Student and I have been learning different programming languages and using different platforms to expand my knowledge and abilities in programming since around 2018. During this time I have gained <br> sufficient - proficient knowledge in languages such as C++, Python, HTML, utilising software like Visual Basic, Visual Studio and more simplistic IDEs. My interest and abilities in technology go further with my learning <br> and practice of building and modifying computers since 2022. <br> <br>

I am currently expanding my abilities on the languages I already know (C++, Python and HTML). </t>
